# Coding with a mac french keyboard
:hp-tags: coding, OSX, tips

Coding requires some specific characters such as

----
 [ ] { } ( ) \
----

Unfortunately the Apple french keyboard (wireless or macbook) does not show brackets, curlybraces and backslash.

Also, a lot of characters are available with key combination but not displayed on the keyboard.

Learning these combinations is an option.

Displaying the available characters is another.
To do so, select “Afficher Visualiseur de clavier” in top menu bar (aside of clock)

This may need to activate the icon to appear from “Préférences Système > Clavier”
