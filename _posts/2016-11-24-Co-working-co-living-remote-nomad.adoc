Remote working is great, doing it since 2005 and love it for many many reasons.  

I already worked from home, local co-working spaces, coffee shops, car, train, plane. 
I don't want to limit myself to home or local co-working spaces, this is why I want to go abroad for a week or more of remote working (work and explore).
