= How I use Meteor, Elm and Tailwind together
:published_at: 2020-06-11
:hp-tags: meteor, elm, parcel, tailwind
:toc:

I worked with Elm last year and honestly it was an excellent experience.
I really like it and I would like to use Elm in all my new projects.
But I also like Meteor and three weeks ago I started using it again.
I discovered Meteor in 2015, I gave a talk about it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxIvfQXTqVo) and it still feels like "Wow!" when you start a project.
So in this post I'll explain how I make the two work together, adding tailwind for the UI part (because I love tailwind too 😍) from scratch.


== Prerequisite

You only need two things:

- Your favourite IDE (VSCode with the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elmtooling.elm-ls-vscode[Elm extension] fits very well)
- A browser

You don't need to install NPM, Node or Mongo.
All this stuff is already packaged in Meteor environment.

So to run a NPM command we will use `meteor npm xxx`, and for Mongo, we will use `meteor mongo`.

So let's begin 😁

== Meteor

=== Install Meteor

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84738510-53981b80-afaa-11ea-8d02-cdf6c42c26c0.png[]

Here are the commands to install Meteor on OSX/Linux and Windows
OSX / Linux

```shell
# OSX/Linux
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

# Windows
choco install meteor
```

NOTE: For more informations about the installation, you can go here https://www.meteor.com/install

=== Create a project

Let's start by creating an empty project

```shell
meteor create meteor-elm-app --bare
cd meteor-elm-app
```

This command will create an empty project with static-html instead of blaze and without autopublish and insecure

NOTE: For more informations about the command create, you can go here https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteorcreate


=== Add typescript

Adding Typescript is really simple, run these two commands

```shell
# under meteor-elm-app
meteor add typescript
meteor npm i -D @types/meteor @types/mocha
```

Create a tsconfig.json under the directory `meteor-elm-app`
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      /* Basic Options */
      "target": "es2018",
      "module": "esNext",
      "lib": ["esnext", "dom"],
      "allowJs": true,
      "checkJs": false,
      "incremental": false,
      "noEmit": true,
  
      /* Strict Type-Checking Options */
      "strict": true,
      "noImplicitAny": true,
      "strictNullChecks": true,
  
      /* Additional Checks */
      "noUnusedLocals": true,
      "noUnusedParameters": true,
      "noImplicitReturns": false,
      "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": false,
  
      /* Module Resolution Options */
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        /* Support absolute ~imports/* with a leading '/' */
        "/*": ["*"]
      },
      "moduleResolution": "node",
      "resolveJsonModule": true,
      "types": ["node", "mocha"],
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "preserveSymlinks": true,
    },
    "exclude": [
      "./.meteor/**",
      "./packages/**"
    ]
  }
```

NOTE: This configuration comes from the typescript template provided by Meteor.
I just removed the support of JSX.

=== Create the file structure

NOTE: We will setup a simple file structure here, for more complex projects, you should follow the guideline provided by Meteor https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html#javascript-structure

Run these commands
```shell
# under meteor-elm-app
mkdir client server imports/api
touch client/main.html client/main.ts client/main.css server/main.ts
```

Your folder should be like this:

```shell
# under meteor-elm-app
❯ tree -I node_modules                                              
.
├── client
│   ├── main.css
│   ├── main.html
│   └── main.ts
├── imports
│   └── api
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── server
    └── main.ts

4 directories, 6 files
```

We will update the `package.json` file to define the main modules in our Meteor app:

```json
"meteor": {
    "mainModule": {
        "client": "client/main.ts",
        "server": "server/main.ts"
    }
}
```

At this time your `package.json` file should be like:
```json
{
  "name": "meteor-elm-app",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "meteor run"
  },
  "meteor": {
    "mainModule": {
      "client": "client/main.ts",
      "server": "server/main.ts"
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "^7.8.3",
    "meteor-node-stubs": "^1.0.0"
  }
}

```

NOTE: if you need more informations about this mainModule options, you can read the content of this pull request https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/9690

We need now to add some basic content to the `main.html` file:

```html
<head>
  <title>meteor-elm-app</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="main">Elm app will be here</div>
</body>
```

=== Checkpoint

Let's check if everything is OK before starting with Elm.
Start your `meteor` server: 
```shell
# under meteor-elm-app
meteor
```

Open http://localhost:3000 on your favorite browser
You should see this:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84446744-8195fc80-ac46-11ea-9da8-4fd2033898bf.png[]


== Elm

=== Install Parcel

We will use Parcel to build our Elm application and we will use the result of this build in our Meteor application

To install Parcel, run this command

```shell
meteor npm i -D parcel
```

=== Install Elm

To install Elm, run this command

```shell
meteor npm i -D elm elm-format
```

NOTE: elm-format is not mandatory but you should use it with your IDE to format on save and avoid problem at compile time

We will also create a `script` in the `package.json` to call Elm easily.
In your package.json, add this `elm` script:
```json
"scripts": {
    "elm": "cd packages/elm-app/app && elm",
    "start": "meteor run"
},
```

You can validate your script is well configured by running:
```shell
meteor npm run elm -- --version
```

You should see the version of Elm:
```
> elm "--version"

0.19.1
```


=== Create a Meteor package

This Meteor package will contain our Elm application.
Then we will use this package inside the Meteor application

Let's start by creating some folders:
```shell
mkdir -p packages/elm-app/{app,dist}
```

The `app` folder will contain the sources of our Elm application (Elm, TS and CSS files).
The `dist` folder will contain the result of the build made by Parcel.

Because we will build with Parcel and not with Meteor, we will create a new file at the root of the `meteor-elm-app` called `.meteorignore`

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
touch .meteorignore
```

Then add this line inside this new file:
```
/packages/elm-app/app/**/*
```

Because we don't want to push the `dist` and the `elm-stuff` folders on our repository, we will add them in the `.gitignore` located under the folder `meteor-elm-app`

```
dist
elm-stuff
```

Now, let's create a `package.js` file in our package:

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app
touch package.js
```

And add the following content in this file:
```js
Package.describe({
    name: 'elm-app',
    version: '1.0.0',
    summary: 'elm app',
    documentation: 'add your elm app into meteor',
});

Package.onUse(function (api) {
    api.versionsFrom('1.10.2');
    api.use('modules');
    api.addFiles('dist/elm-app.css', 'client');
    api.mainModule('dist/elm-app.js', 'client');
});
```

`Package.describe` says that our package:

- is called `elm-app`,
- is in version `1.0.0`

`Package.onUse` says that our package:

- is implemented to be use with Meteor `1.10.2`, 
- uses the `modules` package because we will use `import {} from ''`,
- will add the `dist/elm-app.css` file in the client when it will be loaded,
- have a main js file for this package called `dist/elm-app.js`.

If you are using `elm-css` and if you don't need specific css classes in your app, you can remove `api.addFiles('dist/elm-app.css', 'client');` from the `package.js` file.

NOTE: For more informations about the Package.js file, see https://docs.meteor.com/api/packagejs.html

=== Create the app

We will create our Elm application under the folder `packages/elm-app/app`.
To do that, run the following command:

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app
meteor npm run elm -- init
```

Validate the creation of the `elm.json` file and we are good 👍.

At this step, your folder should be like this:

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
❯ tree -I 'node_modules|.meteor' -a
.
├── .gitignore
├── .meteorignore
├── client
│   ├── main.css
│   ├── main.html
│   └── main.ts
├── imports
│   └── api
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── packages
│   └── elm-app
│       ├── app
│       │   ├── elm.json
│       │   └── src
│       ├── dist
│       └── package.js
└── server
    └── main.ts

9 directories, 10 files
```

In a first time, we will create a simple Elm application.

Create a `Main.elm` file inside the folder `packages/elm-app/app/src` with this content:

```elm
module Main exposing(main)

import Browser
import Html exposing (Html, text)

type alias Model = String

main : Program () Model msg
main =
    Browser.element
        { init = init
        , view = view
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        }

init: () -> (Model, Cmd msg)
init _ =
    ("Hello from Elm app", Cmd.none)

view: Model -> Html msg
view model =
    text model

update: msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd msg)
update _ model =
    (model, Cmd.none)

subscriptions : Model -> Sub msg
subscriptions _ =
    Sub.none
```

=== The CSS main file

In the folder `meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app`, create an empty `main.scss` SCSS file (or CSS if you prefer) that we will use later to add some style in our Elm application.

NB: if you use `elm-css` and you don't need a stylesheet, skip this step and remove the line `api.addFiles('dist/elm-app.css', 'client');` in the package.js file

=== The Package mainModule

In the folder `meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app`, create a file `index.ts` that will *mount* our Elm application and export the `ports`.

A simple version could:

```ts
import './main.scss'
const { Elm } = require('./src/Main.elm')

export const init = (configuration: any) => {
    const app = Elm.Main.init(configuration)
    return app.ports
}
```

But because we want to Type thing as much as possible, let's create this `index.ts` like this:

```ts
import './main.scss'
const { Elm } = require('./src/Main.elm')

interface Flags {}

export interface Configuration {
    node: HTMLElement | null,
    flags: Flags
}

export interface Ports {}

export const init: (configuration: Configuration) => Ports = (configuration) => {
    const app = Elm.Main.init(configuration)
    return app.ports
}
```

With this definition, when we will need some flags or some ports, we will add the new stuff in our interface and the client will have to implement them.

NOTE: Take care of the first line if you don't use SCSS but a `main.css` file

=== Build with Parcel

Let's create a build script in our `package.json` file:
```json
"elm:build": "parcel build packages/elm-app/app/index.ts -d packages/elm-app/dist --out-file elm-app.js --no-cache",
```

This script will build our application in a file `elm-app.js` (and `elm-app.css`) and put it in the folder `packages/elm-app/dist` (the one we added in our `.gitignore`) 


We can test our script

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
meteor npm run elm:build
```

If everything is ok, you should see these lines:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84450020-4ea43680-ac4f-11ea-9b45-ce0dfb572835.png[]


=== Add our package to Meteor 

We have a package, but we must add it in our Meteor configuration.

NOTE: you must have run the previous build command before adding the package because without a dist folder, you will not be able to add this package.

Execute this command to add the package

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
meteor add elm-app
```

You should see

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84450082-7abfb780-ac4f-11ea-92f4-db936ee6f726.png[]


=== Post install

To avoid to have to compile manually each time someone clone the repository, we will add a `postinstall` script in the `package.json` file:

```json
"postinstall": "meteor npm run elm:build",
```

== Use the Elm application in our Meteor client

Now that we have our Elm application, it is time to import it in the client part of our Meteor application

In the `client/main.ts` file, add the following code:

```ts
import { init } from "meteor/elm-app";
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';

Meteor.startup(() => {
    const ports = init({
        node: document.getElementById("main"),
        flags: {}
    })
})
```

In this code, we import the `init` function from the package `meteor/elm-app` which is the package we have just created (you can see it in the file `.meteor/packages`).
Then we call it to mount our Elm application on the node `document.getElementById("main")` (the one we have created in the `main.html` file)

Now, if you start your meteor application by running the `meteor` command, on http://localhost:3000 you should see:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84450699-4a791880-ac51-11ea-9c51-c0046cc273a0.png[]

But...

=== The typing is not good

You should see that your import is underlined in red:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84450825-9c21a300-ac51-11ea-9243-78a13ecad82d.png[]

To fix that, we will add a declaration file:
```shell 
#under meteor-elm-app
mkdir -p types/meteor
touch types/meteor/elm-app.d.ts
```

And add the following content

```ts
declare module 'meteor/elm-app' {
    export const init: (
        configuration: import('~packages/elm-app/app').Configuration,
    ) => import('~packages/elm-app/app').Ports;
}
```

Now each time we will change the definition of the type `Flag` or the type `Port` inside our Elm application, we will be sure to know if we have some stuff to fix in the Meteor client 💪

== Live Reload
Because we don't want to build manually our Elm application each time we make a change, we will setup the live reload

first install this packages
```shell
meteor npm i -D concurrently wait-on rimraf
```

then we will create an new script entry:

```json
"elm:watch": "parcel watch packages/elm-app/app/index.ts -d packages/elm-app/dist --out-file elm-app.js",
```

With `elm:watch`, parcel will rebuild our app each time we make a change in Elm, TS or SCSS files.

Now to run parcel and meteor in //, we will rename the script `start` to `meteor:run`, and redefine the `start`:

```json
"meteor:run": "meteor run",
"start": "rimraf \"./packages/elm-app/dist/*\" && concurrently -n \"parcel,meteor\" -c \"magenta,green\" \"meteor npm run elm:watch\" \"wait-on ./packages/elm-app/dist/elm-app.js && meteor npm run meteor:run\"",
```

And because `parcel watch` create a `.cache` folder, we will add it to the `.gitignore` file.

== Tailwind

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
```
meteor npm i -D tailwindcss
```

```
cd packages/elm-app/app
npx tailwindcss init
```

edit main.scss

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

postcss.config.js
```
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
      require("tailwindcss"),
      require("autoprefixer")
    ],
};

```

edit Main.elm
```
view: Model -> Html msg
view model =
    div [class "text-green-500"] [text model]
```

== The TODO app
```
../../../node_modules/.bin/elm install elm/svg elm/json NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline
```

== Conclusion

Congratulations 🎉! You made your first application with Elm and Meteor 👏.
